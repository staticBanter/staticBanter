> Regular Developer

EH everyone you can call me staticBanter, and i am a regular developer; 
* I stay up late pulling my hair out over bugs(that don't actually matter) :face_with_spiral_eyes:
* I run on pure coffee and pizza. :coffee: :pizza:
* I often find myself doing my best work in my sleep :sleeping:

If you have any problems with your code don't forget to blame me :upside_down_face:

Now go out there and have a delightful day :sunny: or night :full_moon:

Sincerely;
staticBanter

P.S: come check out my plain Web-Site over at [staticBlogs](https://staticblogs.ca), it's kinda bare right now but in the future it might become something... :man_shrugging:
